# LinuxDebianSetup

In order for this, we want the Debian side of Linux (.deb) since that uses the apt setup, thing is that setting things up takes time, and i don't have the time to setup everything i ever want in one quick sweep.

I have done this for myself, so others can download if necessary. But this requires the use of Terminal.

so for the start its from where you download this script to.

sudo chmod +x script.sh (press enter)
then 
./script.sh 
it MAY prompt for a password again because it uses the sudo command, it will work just as it would normally.
